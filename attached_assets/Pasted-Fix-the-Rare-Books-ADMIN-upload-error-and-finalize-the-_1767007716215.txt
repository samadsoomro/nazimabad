Fix the Rare Books ADMIN upload error and finalize the system.

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Admin fills all fields correctly:
  - Title
  - Category
  - Description
  - Cover Image
  - Rare Book PDF
- Clicks "Add Rare Book"
- After loading, system throws:
  "file time not supported" / timeout / upload failed error

This must be fixed permanently.

────────────────────────
1️⃣ ROOT CAUSE FIX (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────

Investigate and fix the upload failure caused by:

- Large PDF upload timeout
- Improper multipart/form-data handling
- Incorrect file stream handling
- Request body size limits
- Server timeout limits
- Improper async file save logic

Apply fixes:
- Increase upload size limit (PDF + image)
- Increase request timeout safely
- Use streaming-based file saving (no memory crash)
- Ensure proper async/await handling
- Validate file AFTER upload, not before stream completes

Result:
✔ No timeout
✔ No "file time not supported" error
✔ Works with large PDFs

────────────────────────
2️⃣ FILE TYPE SUPPORT (STRICT BUT CORRECT)
────────────────────────

Ensure Rare Books module supports:

PDF:
- application/pdf
- Large file sizes supported

Cover Image:
- jpg
- jpeg
- png
- webp

Reject only truly invalid formats.
Do NOT falsely reject valid files.

────────────────────────
3️⃣ DATABASE & FILE CONSISTENCY
────────────────────────

Ensure:
- Database record is created ONLY after files save successfully
- No partial uploads
- No orphan files
- Proper rollback on failure

Fields must store:
- title
- category
- description
- cover_image path
- pdf path
- created_at

────────────────────────
4️⃣ DO NOT BREAK EXISTING FEATURES
────────────────────────

Strict rules:
- Do NOT change UI
- Do NOT change Rare Books preview logic
- Do NOT affect Notes module
- Do NOT affect Borrowed Books
- Do NOT change admin authentication

Only fix upload reliability.

────────────────────────
5️⃣ FINAL VERIFICATION
────────────────────────

Before completing:

- Upload a large Rare Book PDF successfully
- Confirm admin sees it listed
- Confirm normal user can preview it
- Confirm no download possible
- Confirm no errors in console or server logs

────────────────────────
6️⃣ FINALIZE FOR DEPLOYMENT
────────────────────────

After fix:
- Clean upload handling code
- Normalize file paths
- Ensure ZIP export works without corruption
- Ensure project runs correctly after unzip

FINAL RESULT REQUIRED:
✔ Rare Books upload NEVER fails
✔ Large PDFs supported
✔ Preview already works
✔ Security intact
✔ Project stable
✔ Ready to deploy
