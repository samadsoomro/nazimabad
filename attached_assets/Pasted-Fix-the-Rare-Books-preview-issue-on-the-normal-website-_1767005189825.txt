Fix the Rare Books preview issue on the normal website and finalize the project for deployment.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Admin uploads Rare Book PDF successfully
- Rare Book appears in normal website menu
- When a normal user clicks "View / Preview", the PDF does NOT render
- Download is already disabled (correct)
- Screenshot protection already applied (correct)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Make Rare Books PREVIEW WORK RELIABLY for users while keeping strict security.

1️⃣ FIX RARE BOOK PREVIEW (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────

Ensure Rare Books PDF preview works correctly:

- Use a stable embedded PDF viewer (iframe or secure PDF viewer)
- Ensure correct file path / stream is passed to the viewer
- Handle large PDF files safely (no blank screen)
- Ensure backend sends proper headers for inline viewing

If PDF streaming fails:
- Fallback to buffered stream response
- Ensure no direct file URL is exposed

Result:
✔ User can VIEW the PDF
✔ No download option
✔ No blank page
✔ Works for large PDFs

────────────────────────
2️⃣ SECURITY (KEEP + VERIFY)
────────────────────────

Apply ONLY to Rare Books (do NOT affect Notes):

- Disable right-click
- Disable text selection
- Disable Ctrl+S, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Shift+I
- Prevent direct PDF URL access
- Ensure preview is embedded only

Do NOT loosen security.

────────────────────────
3️⃣ ADMIN SIDE CHECK
────────────────────────

- Ensure Rare Book upload remains stable
- Ensure uploaded PDF + cover_image mapping is correct
- Ensure database records are intact
- No UI redesign

────────────────────────
4️⃣ OPTIMIZE & STABILIZE PROJECT
────────────────────────

Prepare project for deployment:

- Clean unused imports and files
- Ensure file paths are consistent
- Normalize uploads directory structure
- Ensure environment variables are correct
- Confirm no hardcoded local paths
- Ensure no corrupted assets

────────────────────────
5️⃣ FINAL ZIP EXPORT
────────────────────────

Before finishing:

- Verify entire site works:
  - Admin login
  - Rare Books upload
  - Rare Books preview
  - Notes
  - Events
  - Books
  - Library Card

Then:

- Package ALL source files into a clean ZIP
- Ensure ZIP extracts without corruption
- Ensure project runs correctly after extraction

FINAL RESULT REQUIRED:
✔ Rare Books preview works for users
✔ Security intact (view-only)
✔ No blank screens
✔ Project optimized
✔ ZIP ready for GitHub / deployment
