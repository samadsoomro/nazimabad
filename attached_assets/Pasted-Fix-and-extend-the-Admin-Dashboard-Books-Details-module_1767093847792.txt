Fix and extend the Admin Dashboard "Books Details" module.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Book details upload works
- Book appears in normal website Books menu
- BUT uploaded book image is NOT displaying
- Borrowed Books module already exists and works

This task must NOT break any existing feature.

────────────────────────
1️⃣ FIX BOOK IMAGE DISPLAY (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────

Problem:
- Book cover image uploaded in Admin → Books Details
- Image path is saved
- Image does NOT render on normal website Books menu

Fix:
- Ensure correct image storage path
- Ensure public access to uploaded images
- Fix frontend image src binding
- Add fallback image if missing

Rules:
- Do NOT change UI layout
- Do NOT re-upload existing data
- Must work for jpg, jpeg, png, webp

Result:
✔ Book cover image displays correctly everywhere

────────────────────────
2️⃣ EXTEND BOOKS DETAILS MODULE (ADMIN)
────────────────────────

Add the following fields to Books Details:

- total_copies (number, required)
- available_copies (auto-calculated)
- created_at
- updated_at

Logic:
- available_copies = total_copies - active borrowed count
- Prevent borrowing if available_copies = 0

────────────────────────
3️⃣ BORROW TRACKING IN BOOK DETAILS
────────────────────────

Link Books Details with Borrowed Books module.

For each book, show (Admin only):
- List of students who borrowed this book
- Fetch details from Borrowed Books module:
  - Student name
  - Email
  - Phone number
  (from Library Card / Registered user data)
- Borrow date
- Auto return date = borrow_date + 14 days

No duplicate data storage.

────────────────────────
4️⃣ ADMIN ACTIONS
────────────────────────

Add Admin actions per borrowed record:
- Delete / Mark as Returned

On borrow action:
Show popup message:
"You have borrowed the book: <BOOK NAME>.
Please visit the library and return it within 14 days.
We may contact you via phone or email if required."

────────────────────────
5️⃣ AUTOMATION RULES
────────────────────────

- Borrow allowed ONLY if user is logged in
- Borrow allowed ONLY if available_copies > 0
- Return date auto-calculated (14 days)
- No manual return date editing

────────────────────────
6️⃣ SAFETY & STABILITY
────────────────────────

Rules:
- Do NOT modify Borrowed Books logic structure
- Do NOT redesign UI
- Do NOT expose admin-only data to users
- Do NOT break Notes, Rare Books, Events

Ensure:
✔ No blank pages
✔ No console errors
✔ Fast response
✔ Existing data preserved

────────────────────────
FINAL VERIFICATION:
✔ Book image displays on website
✔ Copies logic works correctly
