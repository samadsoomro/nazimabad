FINAL TASK — MUST FIX WITHOUT ANY EXTRA FEATURES

Rename & standardize the module as follows:

ADMIN DASHBOARD MODULE NAME:
➡️ "Books" (remove books details)

This module is ONLY for normal books shown on the website Books menu.
THIS IS NOT Rare Books.
THIS IS NOT Notes.
THIS IS NOT PDF upload.

────────────────────────
ADMIN BOOKS MODULE (STRICT)
────────────────────────

Admin form fields (ONLY these):

- book_name (required)
- short_intro (required)
- description (required)
- book_image (IMAGE ONLY)
- add_book button

REMOVE:
- any unused fields

Image rules:
- Allowed formats: jpg, jpeg, png, webp
- Large image sizes must be supported
- Store image safely (no crashes)

────────────────────────
DATABASE RULES
────────────────────────

Table / Collection: books

Fields:
- id
- book_name
- short_intro
- description
- book_image
- created_at

Ensure:
- Book is saved successfully
- No silent failures
- No duplicate breaking

────────────────────────
BACKEND API (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────

Create / ensure public API endpoint:

GET /api/books

This endpoint MUST:
- Return ALL books from database
- Sort by created_at DESC (latest first)
- Be accessible to normal users

Admin endpoints:
- Add book
- Edit book
- Delete book

DO NOT touch Borrowed Books logic.

────────────────────────
NORMAL WEBSITE — BOOKS MENU (CRITICAL FIX)
────────────────────────

The Books menu MUST:

- Fetch books ONLY from /api/books
- NOT use static data
- NOT use Borrowed Books table
- NOT depend on admin role

Each book card shows:
- Book image
- Book name
- Short intro
- "Borrow" button

Layout:
- Desktop: 4 books per row
- Mobile: 1 book per row

Order:
- Latest uploaded book appears FIRST

────────────────────────
BORROW FLOW (DO NOT CHANGE)
────────────────────────

When user clicks "Borrow":
- Existing Borrowed Books system handles it
- Admin receives request in Borrowed Books module
- User email and phone number stored (already implemented)

DO NOT rework borrow logic.
ONLY connect Books → Borrow button.

────────────────────────
STRICT RULES
────────────────────────

❌ NO PDF upload in Books module
❌ NO Rare Books logic
❌ NO redesign
❌ NO dummy/static data
❌ NO removing old working features

────────────────────────
FINAL ACCEPTANCE CHECK (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────

✔ Admin adds book → saved in DB
✔ Book appears instantly in website Books menu
✔ Latest book on top
✔ Image visible
✔ Borrow button works
✔ Borrow request visible in Admin Borrowed Books
✔ No console errors
✔ No blank pages

THIS IS A DATA CONNECTION FIX.
IMPLEMENT EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED.
DO NOT ADD EXTRA FEATURES.
